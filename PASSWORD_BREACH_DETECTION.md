# Password Breach Detection - Issue #5

## Summary
Implemented password breach detection using the HaveIBeenPwned (HIBP) API to protect users from setting passwords that have been exposed in known data breaches.

## Problem
The OAuth server validated password strength (length, complexity) but didn't check if passwords had been compromised in data breaches. This left users vulnerable to:
- Credential stuffing attacks
- Account takeover from leaked password databases
- Using passwords that are publicly known

## Solution
Integrated with the HaveIBeenPwned Passwords API using the k-Anonymity model to check passwords against a database of over 600 million breached passwords while preserving user privacy.

---

## Features

### 1. **Privacy-Preserving k-Anonymity**
- Only sends first 5 characters of SHA-1 hash to HIBP API
- Password never leaves the server
- No tracking or logging of full passwords
- HIBP doesn't know which specific password is being checked

### 2. **Configurable Fail-Open/Fail-Closed**
- **Fail-Open Mode** (default): Allow password if API is down
- **Fail-Closed Mode**: Reject password if API verification fails
- Prevents service disruption while maintaining security

### 3. **Performance Optimized**
- Configurable timeout (default: 5 seconds)
- Only checked during registration and password changes
- No impact on authentication flows
- Minimal latency (~100-500ms per check)

### 4. **Comprehensive Validation**
Enhanced password validation flow:
1. ✅ Minimum length check (8+ characters)
2. ✅ Complexity requirements (uppercase, lowercase, number, special char)
3. ✅ Breach detection via HIBP API
4. ✅ User-friendly error messages

## Architecture

### How k-Anonymity Works

```
Password: "MyPassword123"
    ↓
SHA-1 Hash: 5F4DCC3B5AA765D61D8327DEB882CF99
    ↓
Split into Prefix (5 chars) and Suffix
Prefix: 5F4DC
Suffix: C3B5AA765D61D8327DEB882CF99
    ↓
Send ONLY prefix to HIBP API
    ↓
API returns ALL hash suffixes starting with prefix
    ↓
Check if our suffix appears in results
```

### Privacy Guarantee
- API receives only 5-character prefix
- Each prefix matches ~131,000 different passwords
- Impossible for HIBP to know which password you're checking

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Breached Password Rejected

**Request:**
```bash
POST /register
{
  "username": "john",
  "password": "password123",
  "email": "john@example.com"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "error": "invalid_request",
  "error_description": "this password has appeared in 1238605 data breaches and is not secure. Please choose a different password"
}
```

### Example 2: Clean Password Accepted

**Request:**
```bash
POST /register
{
  "username": "jane",
  "password": "Z8$kM2!pL7@vN4&qR1#sT",
  "email": "jane@example.com"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "message": "User registered successfully",
  "user_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"
}
```

### Example 3: API Down with Fail-Open

**Configuration:**
```bash
PWNED_PASSWORDS_ENABLED=true
PWNED_PASSWORDS_FAIL_OPEN=true
```

**Behavior:**
- HIBP API is unreachable
- Password validation continues
- Password is allowed (fail-open)
- Error is logged for monitoring

### Example 4: API Down with Fail-Closed

**Configuration:**
```bash
PWNED_PASSWORDS_ENABLED=true
PWNED_PASSWORDS_FAIL_OPEN=false
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "error": "invalid_request",
  "error_description": "unable to verify password security: connection timeout"
}
```

## Integration Points

### 1. Registration Endpoint
```go
// internal/handlers/user.go
func (h *Handler) Register(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    // ... parse request ...

    // Password validation (includes breach check)
    if err := h.auth.ValidatePasswordStrength(password); err != nil {
        // Will return breach error if password is compromised
        respondWithError(w, err)
        return
    }

    // Hash and store password
    // ...
}
```

### 2. Password Change Endpoint
```go
// internal/handlers/user.go
func (h *Handler) ChangePassword(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    // ... validate current password ...

    // Validate new password (includes breach check)
    if err := h.auth.ValidatePasswordStrength(newPassword); err != nil {
        respondWithError(w, err)
        return
    }

    // Update password
    // ...
}
```

### 3. Auth Service Validation
```go
// internal/auth/auth.go
func (s *Service) ValidatePasswordStrength(password string) error {
    // 1. Check length
    // 2. Check complexity
    // 3. Check for breaches (if enabled)

    if s.pwnedChecker.IsEnabled() {
        result := s.pwnedChecker.CheckPassword(password)

        if result.IsBreached {
            return fmt.Errorf("this password has appeared in %d data breaches", result.Count)
        }
    }

    return nil
}
```

  -d '{
    "username": "testuser",
    "password": "password123",
    "email": "test@example.com"
  }'

# Expected: Error about password being breached

curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "username": "testuser",
    "password": "X9$mK2!pL7@vN4&qR8#sT",

# Test performance impact
hey -n 100 -c 10 \
  -m POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"user","password":"TestP@ss123!","email":"user@example.com"}' \
  http://localhost:8080/register

# Monitor:
# - Latency increase (~100-500ms per request)
# - HIBP API rate limits (handled gracefully)
# - Error rate with fail-open/fail-closed
```

## Performance Considerations

### Latency Impact

| Operation | Without Breach Check | With Breach Check | Impact |
|-----------|---------------------|-------------------|--------|
| Registration | ~50ms | ~150-550ms | +100-500ms |
| Password Change | ~50ms | ~150-550ms | +100-500ms |
| Authentication | ~50ms | ~50ms | None (not checked) |

### API Limits
- HIBP API is free and has no hard rate limits
- Recommended: Max 1 request per user session
- Breach check is cached by browser (only on password change)

### Optimization Tips
1. **Only check during password changes** (not on every login)
2. **Use shorter timeout in dev** (faster feedback)
3. **Fail-open in dev** (don't block development)
4. **Fail-closed in prod** (maximum security)

---

## Security Considerations

### What We Send to HIBP
- ✅ First 5 characters of SHA-1 hash
- ❌ Full password
- ❌ Username
- ❌ Email
- ❌ IP address
- ❌ Any user identifier

### What HIBP Knows
- That someone checked a password with a specific 5-character prefix
- Nothing about which exact password was checked
- Nothing about who checked it
- Nothing about your application

### Attack Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: HIBP Database Compromise
**Risk:** Low
**Mitigation:** HIBP only stores SHA-1 hashes (same as we compute), no reverse lookup possible

#### Scenario 2: Man-in-the-Middle Attack
**Risk:** Low
**Mitigation:** HTTPS enforced, only partial hash transmitted, attacker learns nothing useful

#### Scenario 3: HIBP API Unavailability
**Risk:** Medium (service disruption)
**Mitigation:** Fail-open mode allows registration to continue

#### Scenario 4: False Positives
**Risk:** Very Low
**Mitigation:** SHA-1 collision for specific 5-char prefix is extremely rare

## Monitoring & Observability

### Metrics to Track
```
pwned_password_checks_total{result="breached"}
pwned_password_checks_total{result="clean"}
pwned_password_checks_total{result="error"}
pwned_password_api_latency_seconds
pwned_password_api_errors_total
```

### Logging
```
2025-10-25 10:30:15 Password breach detected: seen 1238605 times in data breaches
2025-10-25 10:30:16 HIBP API request failed: connection timeout
```

### Alerts
- **High Error Rate:** > 10% of checks failing
- **High Latency:** p99 > 2 seconds
- **High Breach Rate:** > 50% of passwords breached (user education needed)

## FAQ

### Q: Does this slow down authentication?
**A:** No. Breach checking only happens during registration and password changes, not during login.

### Q: What if the HIBP API is down?
**A:** With fail-open mode (default), users can still register. With fail-closed mode, registration is blocked for security.

### Q: Can HIBP see our users' passwords?
**A:** No. Only a 5-character hash prefix is sent. HIBP cannot determine the actual password.

### Q: What happens if a password is breached after registration?
**A:** Users can continue logging in with it. The breach check only prevents NEW registrations with compromised passwords. Consider implementing periodic password health checks.

### Q: How accurate is the breach detection?
**A:** Very accurate. HIBP contains 600M+ breached passwords from verified data breaches.

### Q: Can users still use common passwords like "password123"?
**A:** No. These will be rejected as they appear in the breach database.

### Q: What's the privacy risk?
**A:** Minimal. The k-Anonymity model ensures HIBP cannot determine which specific password is being checked.

### Q: Should we enable this in production?
**A:** Yes, highly recommended. It significantly improves account security with minimal overhead.

### Q: How do we disable it temporarily?
**A:** Set `PWNED_PASSWORDS_ENABLED=false` in your environment configuration.

```
Subject: Improved Password Security

We've enhanced our password security by checking new passwords against
known data breaches.

When you change your password, we'll verify it hasn't been compromised in
any known security incidents. This helps keep your account more secure.

Your privacy is protected - we use an advanced technique that never shares
your actual password with anyone.

Thank you for helping us keep your account secure!
```

## Future Enhancements

### Periodic Password Health Checks (Issue #TBD)
- Check existing user passwords against breach database
- Notify users if their password appears in new breaches
- Force password reset for highly compromised passwords

### Caching (Issue #TBD)
- Cache breach check results in Redis (24 hour TTL)
- Reduce API calls for commonly attempted passwords
- Improve performance by ~90% for cached results

### Custom Breach Database (Issue #TBD)
- Import HIBP dataset for offline checking
- Eliminate external API dependency
- Sub-millisecond breach checks

### Password Strength Scoring (Issue #TBD)
